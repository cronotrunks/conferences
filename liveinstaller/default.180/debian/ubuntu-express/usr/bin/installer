Installer

This is a installer program for a Ubuntu or Metadistros Live system.
This is the main program, but there is also a couple of libraries to
help it to work. For example the frontends library.
The way it works is simple. It detect the Frontend to use, then
load the module for that frontend. After that, it makes some calls
through the frontend in order to get the info necessary to install.

Once it has the info, partitioning, format, copy de distro to the disk
and configure everything.
