	Description
	-----------

    "peez2" is the partition assistant made for the "Junta de Andalucía" by
"Activa Sistemas".

	Disclaimer
	----------

    This software is intended for low-level operations, and is currently being
tested by "Guadalinex 2005" development team -- although it has been written
by others. Use it at your own risk. For the moment, and as a piece of advice,
test it only with unmounted hard disks containing no important data.

	Files
	-----

libparted1.6-12_1.6.21-1.ext3bug_i386.deb: customized parted library.
peez2_0.7.8_i386.deb:                      Debian package.
peez2_0.7.8.tar.gz:                        whole development tree.

	Installation
	------------

    In [3] there is an image of a bootable minimal Linux CD
("cdlive_pez2.iso") that you can burn to test the software, as it is supposed
to work on unmounted hard disks. Alternatively, you can try it in your current
system. Basic installation procedure follow.

1. Install the Debian package:
	sudo dpkg --install peez2_0.7.8_i386.deb
   Maybe you should also install or update some other packages. Usually these
   are:
	libc6    (>= 2.3.2.ds1-21)
	libntfs5 (>= 1.9.4)
2. Set "peez2" libraries directory:
	export LD_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/peez2
3. In order to check ext3 partitions with its sparse_super feature enabled,
   you will have to install the modified libpart package as well:
	sudo dpkg --install libparted1.6-12_1.6.21-1.ext3bug_i386.deb
   and set:
	export PT_FORCE_EXT3_SPARSE=yes

	Usage
	-----

    See [2] (the documentation provided seems unacurate and incomplete).
