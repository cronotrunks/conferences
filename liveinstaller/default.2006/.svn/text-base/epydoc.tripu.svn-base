# When navigating into modules, Epydoc executes any "import" sentence that
# it founds. This behaviour fails when importing GTK, because a
# "pygtk.require" sentence is needed before, and Epydoc is not intelligent
# enough to recognize it. That is why this patch exists :-)

import pygtk
pygtk.require ('2.0')
